A simple program that tells you your current attendance percentage in a subject.

You must pass it two things:
  1. Number of Classes Attended.
  2. Total Number of Classes Conducted.

If you set the desired percentage for a subject (default is 85%) then,
  1. It tells you the number of classes that is required to meet your desired percentage.
  2. Also tells you have much percentage is required to meet your desired percentage.
